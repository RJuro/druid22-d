# Discussion: DRUID 2021 Session - Organisation Behaviour
Roman Jurowetzki, Aalborg University Business School, DK

# Organization structure of development and firm innovation
Jiho Yang, Paola Criscuolo

## Recap

* **How does organizational structure influence development outcomes?** - R&D unbundling
* centralization of development and mechanisms influencing innovative outcomes
* avoiding duplication vs ensuring implementation (transaction costs when transferring outcomes across units)
* it depends: "...need for considering the nature of tasks when predicting the effect of organization structure on firm outcomes."
* additional contributions corporate strategy and structure: "no optimal organization structure for relatively diversified firm."

## Feedback
* First
* Well written
* Detailed view on R&D
* Nice case and rich data
* Relevant results / managerial implications

## More Feedback
* What happened to the interviews?
* Is the new central unit complementary / competing?
* Can you be more explicit about your fundings upfront?
* Interaction of qualitative & quantitative elements wrt results
* Cosine Similarity important measure: robustness check here: STS checks
* What does cosine similarity to previeous tell us here? Also, max-value is very low.

# The relational value of innovation units
Katherine Tatarinov, Tina Ambos, Julian Birkinshaw

## Recap
* Ambidexterity in innovation units
* Do innovation units contribute more than just with product/process innovation?
* are they shaping valuable relations in the organization?
* Propositions
    * Complexity of the context and relational value (positive link)
    * Breadth (scope) of the relational value i.e. internal/external; linking/building vs longevity and legitimity (positive link)
    * Evolution of the organizations - processes of ambidexterity and integration

## Feedback

* exciting case within a "mission-oriented" context
* awareness of the potential transferability issues to to other settings
* Managerial implications?
* Do we (in the good cases) observe increasing complexity and "organizational power" as the unit matures?
* Could there be a quantitative follow-up? Abductive / Theory building?


# Innovation configurations and firm performance: an fsQCA approach
Ed Saiedi, Simon Okwir, Vikash Sinha

## Recap

* different combinations of innovation dypes (configurations) given variable regulation and size
* fsQCA used to look at performance (- intereting method)
* distinguish knowledge-intensive vs research-intensive
* identify configurations that deliver performance

## Feedback
* interesting method
* ambition to explore more complex configurations / specific cases between quant/qual

* what do we learn? Describing more â‰  explaining more?

* >In lightly regulated industries, knowledge-intensive firms in the majority of the identified cases were able to achieve high performance when they combined their process innovation with marketing innovation


## More Feedback
* role of industry
* >innovation configuration leading to high firm performance are greatly influenced by the industrial context
* Is it a part of the German CIS?
* wordy (I'm no expert in this particular area)
* descriptive pre-study to a quantitative exerciese
